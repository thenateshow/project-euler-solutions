# project-euler-solutions
A compilation of my solutions, working and in-progress, for Project Euler problems.

Project Euler website: https://projecteuler.net/

For any problem-solving enthusiasts, I highly recommend checking out the challenges here. They are great exercises to work through and code, and have an emphasis on performance and efficiency. I have learned a bunch of neat math tricks when working through these, it's really a lot of fun!

The website doesn't have an integrated IDE or anything, so you can use whatever language you'd like in your preferred environment. They give a question and accept an answer, the entire middle part is up to you. Any of my solutions can be ran locally and will output the answer to the respective problem in the archive.
